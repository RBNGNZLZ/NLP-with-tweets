\section{Abstract}

% Abstract: within 150 words. What is the problem? How did you solve it? What are the final results?

This research aims to utilize natural language processing to produce a machine learning model capable of classifying posts from users of the social media website Twitter as pertaining, or not pertaining, to occurrences of natural disasters. Using a corpus of training and testing data provided by the company Figure Eight, four machine learning models were trained and optimized against already-classified posts from Twitter. After training the models, predictions were ran against a corpus of new, unclassified, and unseen Twitter posts and the accuracy of each of the models evaluated. The four models utilized were multinomial naive Bayes, random forest, logisitic regression, and a multi-layer perceptron convolutional neural network (MLP). Of these models, the multinomial naive bayes model performed the best, accurately classifying 80.21\% of previously unseen and unclassified Twitter posts.
